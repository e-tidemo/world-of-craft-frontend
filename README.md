### Bugs
I ran into an issue with uncompatible versions of React, NodeJs and React Router which resulted in an issue where the links I clicked in the navbar called the correct url but the pages themselves didn't show up until the page was reloaded. I solved it by uninstalling the NodeJs version I had installed and installing an older version (v14.21.3) and by upgrading the React Router to v6.22.3. I then found some resources on how to switch from React Router v5 to v6, the most helpful being this one: [React Router V5 vs V6](https://dev.to/arunavamodak/react-router-v5-vs-v6-dp0) by Arunava Modak.
